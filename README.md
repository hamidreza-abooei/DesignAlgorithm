This repository contains some sort of solutions for some problems presented in Design algorithm course in  department of CE @ AUT

three projects and two minor codes are available in this repo.

## Project 1
We have some cubes with 6 colors and diffrent weights. We want to Create the tallest tower that lighter cubes places on top of prior cube and the face of prior cube face has the same color of the bottom color face of the posterior cube.

## Project 2
Solving n-queen problem with some walls.

## Project 3
Solving n-queen problem with some walls and any blocks have a number. Sum of queens places number should be higher than a threshold


### code 1
Finding two numbers from a list of unsorted numbers and find two numbers that their summation is a random number "S"

### code 2
finding highest summation in subarrays with Divide and Conquer.
