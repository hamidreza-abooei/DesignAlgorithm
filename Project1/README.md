# Project 1
We have some cubes with 6 colors and diffrent weights. We want to Create the tallest tower that lighter cubes places on top of prior cube and the face of prior cube face has the same color of the bottom color face of the posterior cube.

# Answer Dynamic programming
first we sort all of the cubes corresponding to their weights. then we calculate tallest tower heights when we add a new heavier cube. 
then we pick the highest number as the solution of this project
